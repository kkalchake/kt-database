# Notes from *Thinking, Fast and Slow*  
**Daniel Kahneman** 

Reflections that stayed with me, inspired the way I think about attention, effort, and the hidden signals the body sends when the mind is at work.

-------------------------------------------------------------
“Eckhard Hess described the pupil of the eye as a window to the soul” [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/attitude-and-pupil-size](Attitude and Pupil Size, By Eckhard H. Hess in Scientific American Magazine) 

- This idea opens the foundation for understanding how the human pupil reflects internal cognitive activity.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Effort Has a Signature 
“pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. ”

- This inspires me because it shows that *effort is visible*. When I’m working hard—when I stretch myself mentally—my body responds. Effort isn’t abstract; it’s measurable, real, and embodied. There’s a small sense of validation in this: when I push myself, my biology acknowledges it.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Thought Made Visible
“We worked for some months in a spacious basement suite in which we had set up a closed-circuit system that projected an image of the subject’s pupil on a screen in the corridor; we also could hear what was happening in the laboratory. The diameter of the projected pupil was about a foot; watching it dilate and contract when the participant was at work was a fascinating sight, quite an attraction for visitors in our lab”

- The idea of watching someone's cognitive effort expand into a one-foot-wide projection feels almost poetic: the invisible made visible.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## The Body Knows Before We Do  
“As we watched from the corridor, we would sometimes surprise both the owner of the pupil and our guests by asking, “Why did you stop working just now?” The answer from inside the lab was often, “How did you know?” to which we would reply, “We have a window to your soul.”

- This stays with me. Attention shifts before we notice it, and the body signals the change. It’s a quiet reminder to stay aware of my inner rhythm.

-------------------------------------------------------------
These notes remind me that thinking has texture, shape, and presence.
