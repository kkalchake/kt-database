# Threat vs. Challenge Response

A side-by-side comparison of how the body and mind interpret and respond to stress.

## Summary Table

| **Feature** | **Threat Response** | **Challenge Response** |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Psychological State / Interpretation** | Anxious, Fearful, Uncertain. Feeling threatened. Characterized by withdrawal and defeat. | Hopeful, Excited, Confident. Feeling energized/challenged. Creates psychological conditions to engage fully, perform at your best, and win. |
| **Physiological State / Mechanism** | Prepares you to shrug down and tolerate the pain. Associated with experiencing a strong blood flow out of the heart (vasoconstriction). | A positive arousal in the sympathetic nervous system, putting you in a more powerful, more focused state. Heart rate increases, and more of your blood is oxygenated (especially to the heart and brain). |
| **Adrenal / Hormonal Action** | N/A (Implied: Cortisol persists) | Your adrenal gland gives you a nice shot of cortisol to increase your energy, but then your brain quickly and firmly shuts off cortisol secretion. |
| **Outcome / Behavior** | Can lead to feeling more prone to feeling threatened. Associated with worse immune function and developing dementia. | Associated with making more accurate decisions and doing better on tasks. Linked to better brain aging and a reduced risk of developing dementia. Athletes who win more often show this response. |
| **Effect on Telomeres** | A predominant habitual response can, over time, work itself into your cells and grind down your telomeres. | A predominant response may help shield your telomeres from some of the worst effects of chronic stress. Those who felt challenge had longer telomeres. |
| **Learning / Shaping** | N/A | You can learn to feel challenged instead. You can shape stress to your purpose by shifting the way you view those events. |
