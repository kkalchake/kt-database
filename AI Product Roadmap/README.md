## ⚠️ AI Product Challenges

**Building AI products is very high relative to normal software projects:**
- ❌ Failure rate of ML projects is very high  
- 🔄 Much more complexity and uncertainty  
- ⚙️ Higher degree of technical risk  

---

## 🎯 Course Goals to Improve ML Product Success

The **AI PO course** provides two key elements:
- ✅ Intuitive foundation of ML knowledge  
- 🛠️ Best practices on building ML products  

---

## 💡 Why This Course Is Important

This course is an important asset to our portfolio because:
- 🏭 Industries utilize ML and AI to make their products and services **more predictive, more personalized, more automated**  
- 🌍 AI is creating opportunities for problems that the world couldn’t find solutions for  
- 🤝 It takes a team to successfully launch a product/project  
- 📢 Defines jargon language to communicate effectively in industries  

> **GOAL:** COME BACK AFTER CONCLUDING THE COURSE TO EVALUATE HOW WELL WE DID BELOW.

## 🧩 M1: What is Machine Learning?

> “Field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”  
> — 1959, IBM - Arthur Samuel (father of Machine Learning)  
> 👉 [Source](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/greatworks/samuel.pdf)

## 🧠 От Шашек до Искусственного Интеллекта: Удивительный Секрет Машинного Обучения

> Самообучение началось не с формул, а с **шашек**  
1959 год. Артур Сэмюэл (IBM) хотел обучить компьютер играть в шашки.  
Он понял: **невозможно** прописать стратегию на каждый ход.  

✅ Он отказался от команд. Вместо этого — дал машине способность к **самосуду**.  
Машина играла с собой, училась на победах и ошибках. Она **не забывала**.

➡️ В 1962 году победила настоящего мастера.  
Сэмюэл доказал: интеллект можно построить **не на знаниях, а на способности учиться**.

## 🤖 ML vs. Traditional Software

| Traditional Software | Machine Learning |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Rules-based logic    | Experience-based predictions |
| Input + Rules = Output | Input + Model + Training Data = Output |

📊 ML systems adjust rules based on **past performance**, not just pre-coded logic.

---

## 🧬 AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

- **Artificial Intelligence** (broad umbrella)
  - **Machine Learning** (subset of AI)
    - **Deep Learning** (subset of ML using neural networks)

Includes domains like:
- 📷 Computer Vision  
- 🧠 NLP  
- 🎯 Recommendation Systems

## 🗓️ ML History Timeline

- 📈 Early 1800 — Origins of Statistical Learning  
- 🧪 1943–1960 — Neural networks + early AI theory  
- 🧱 1980–1990 — Modern ML Foundations  
- 🚀 2009–Now — Deep Learning Boom  

---

## 🔠 Data Terminology

> **Data** = characteristics or information, usually numerical, collected through observation.

📌 **Types of data that can be transformed into numbers:**
- Measurements  
- Text  
- Images  
- Videos  
- Sound  

📍 **Data relationships:**
- **Spatial** — proximity or distance in space  
- **Temporal** — proximity or distance in time  

---

## 🏗️ Structured vs Unstructured Data

| Structured Data | Unstructured Data |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Predefined fields | No fixed format |
| Relational databases | Images, video, sound, text |
| Easy to analyze | Needs specialized tools |

🧠 Most real-world data is **80% unstructured**.

---

## 🔢 Types of Data

### Continuous vs Categorical
- **Continuous:** infinite values (height, time, temp)  
- **Categorical:** distinct groups (gender, color)  

✅ **Discrete:** countable values (age, year)

---

## ⏱️ Time Series Data
- Points in **chronological order**
- Assumptions:
  - Time flows one-way  
  - Nearby points in time are more related

---

## 📚 Terminology

| Term Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Features / X** | Input variables (independent) |
| **Target / Y** | Output variable (dependent) |
| **Observations** | Rows / examples / feature vectors |

---

## 🧠 What is a Model?

> A **model** is an approximation of the relationship between variables

🧩 A model consists of:
1. **Features to use**  
2. **Algorithm** (template or form)  
3. **Hyperparameters**  
4. **Loss function** – quantifies error, our job is to **minimize error**

---

## 🧪 Types of Machine Learning

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Learn from labeled data | Classification, Regression |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Group unlabeled data | Clustering, Anomaly detection |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learn by interaction | AlphaZero, Autonomous vehicles |

---

## 📈 Regression vs Classification

### Regression
- Predict **numeric** value  
- Example: home prices, energy usage  

### Classification
- Predict **class/category**  
- Example: spam vs not spam, disease detection  

⚠️ For ML to succeed:
> Requires **sufficient quantity and quality** of data

---

## ✅ What ML is Good For

- Automating repetitive tasks  
- Predicting input-output relationships  
- Personalizing experiences  

---

## ❌ What ML is NOT Good For

- Understanding context  
- Explaining *why* things happen  
- Determining causation  
- Explaining *how to fix* things  

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

**What is ML?**  
> A way to program computers to learn from experience, to complete a task without explicit instructions, using sufficient data to learn patterns.

**Types of ML:**  
> 3 Types — Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning

**Used For Today:**  
> Automation, Prediction, Personalization

**What ML Can’t Do:**  
> Explain "why" or "how to fix"
